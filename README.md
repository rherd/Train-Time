# Train-Time

This webpage uses firebase to store user input and save it for use by the webpage. The user will input a train name, destination, and the first arrival of the train, as well as the frequency of the train arriving at the station. These values are stored in firebase, and momentjs is used to manipulate the frequency, first arrival, and current time to calculate the next arrival of the train. 

This webpage uses javascript and jquery for DOM manipulation, bootstrap and css for styling, and a firebase call to preserve user input for later use.
